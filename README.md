Planned to start with simple spring boot project and increametally add spring micro services comonents. Due to time constraints, submitting what I have so far developed an Angular UI, and backend.

Spring data jpa used to minimize impact by replacing non RDBMS data sources. Had plan to change to Spring Data Rest consumed by business layer at microservices later.
